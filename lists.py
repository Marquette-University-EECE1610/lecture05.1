This file contains comments for creating lists. The comments are instructions for GitHub Copilot to generate code that creates and prints various lists. The lists include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and mixed types. The code will demonstrate how to create and print these lists in Python. Provide comments explaining each step of the code.

- Create a list of integers called 'numbers' containing the values: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
- Create a list of the numbers from 1 to 10 using the range() function and assign it to a variable called 'one_to_ten'
- Create a list of strings called 'fruits' containing: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"
- Create a list of mixed types called 'student_info' containing: "Alice", 20, 3.8, True
- Print each list to see its contents
