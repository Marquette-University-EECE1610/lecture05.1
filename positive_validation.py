Input Validation

GitHub Copilot Instructions:
- Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a positive integer.
- If the user enters a non-positive integer (zero or negative), the program should keep asking until a positive integer is entered.
- If the user doesn't enter a valid integer (e.g., they enter a string), the program should catch the error and prompt them again without crashing.
- When the user finally enters a positive number, tell them "Thank you!" and what their number was.
